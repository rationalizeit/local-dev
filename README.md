# Local Dev

This repository houses simple scripts to automate the provisioning of a local development
environment at Rationalize IT, LLC. The goal is to support Windows, Linux and OS X.


## Windows

For windows we use `Chocolatey` and `BoxStarter`. Most of the work here is inspired by: https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts


## OS X

For OS X we use `Homebrew`
